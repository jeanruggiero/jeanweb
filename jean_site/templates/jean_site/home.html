        Hi, I'm Jean! I’m an aerospace engineer turned product manager turned computer science grad student. My interests include embedded sensing
        systems, data science, and scientific computation. I’m currently working as a part-time data science intern at Fortive while completing my
        master's degree in computer science at Northeastern University.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prior to graduate school, I earned a bachelors degree in aerospace engineering from Purdue University and worked Boeing for five years. I
        was a flight test engineer for four years and a product manager for one year. Today, I’m living in Seattle, WA while pursuing a master's
        degree in computer science at Northeastern University.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I’m not coding, I can be found trail running, cycling, climbing, cooking, or frantically searching the web for the release date of
        J.&nbsp;Kenji Lopez-Alt’s next book.
