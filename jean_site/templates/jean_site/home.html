<p id="about">Hi, I'm Jean! I started my professional life off as an
    aerospace engineer at Purdue University and then Boeing in
    Seattle, WA. I was a flight test engineer for four years and a
    product manager for one. Today, I’m living in Boston, MA while
    pursuing a master's degree in computer science. I’m seeking an
    internship for summer 2020. Get in touch!</p>
