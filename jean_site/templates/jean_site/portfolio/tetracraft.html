<p>For my senior design project, I led a team in the development and
    manufacture of an unmanned aircraft for agricultural imaging applications
    . The goal was to design and build an unmanned aircraft that could be
    launched in the field and used to capture aerial images of crops that
    could be later analyzed to glean data about crop health. 3D printing was
    selected as the means of manufacture because it enables rapid
    fabrication, little assembly time, and fast generation of replacement
    parts. At the time of completion, it was believed to be the world’s
    largest 3D printed aircraft! The design was selected as the Best Overall
    in the <a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/society-news/asme-news/students-vie-top-prizes-iam3d-old-guard-student">
        2014 ASME IAM3D Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>Below is a brief overview of the project. See the <a href="
{% static "tetracraft_final_design_report.pdf" %}" download>
    final design report</a> for a more thorough description of the design process
    including trade studies, analyses completed, and test results. At the
    end of the project, a short demonstration flight was flown as a proof
    of concept. Check out
    a video of the Tetracraft in flight <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhjf-HuC13g&_ga=2.44470244.1162963421.1573439234-593674200.1572136660">

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Without easily accessible data about crop health, farmers have little choice but to equally distribute resources (water, fertilizer, pesticides) across their planted land. If farmers had real-time data on the health of their crop, they could make informed decisions about how to allocate resources. The result is higher yields, reduced waste, and lower operating costs.</p>

<h2>Design Requirements</h2>
<p>The goal of the project was to design an unmanned aircraft that would allow farmers to capture aerial crop health data. The following requirements informed the design. The design needed to be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>transportable in a standard size pickup truck.</li>
    <li>flyable by someone without extensive training.</li>
    <li>launchable and recoverable without use of an established airstrip.</li>
    <li>able to image 60 acres of crops in a single mission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>The design of the Tetracraft followed a standard iterative aircraft design process. An outer mold line, the shape of the exterior surface of the aircraft, was selected based on principles of  aerodynamics and the given design requirements. A blended wing body arrangement was selected based on the size constraints. </p>

<h3>Aerodynamics, Stability, and Control</h3>
<p class="c2-9">A computer-based model of the aircraft was developed and
    preliminary
    aerodynamic and stability analyses were performed using XFLR5 and AVL. A preliminary payload including the imaging sensor and avionics was selected. A weight estimate was developed based on estimated weights of the aircraft structure, payload, propulsion system, and battery pack. Several iterations were completed by modifying the parameters of the design until the outer mold line supported the estimated weight of the aircraft. In later iterations, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software was used to perform more sophisticated analyses. A rough prototype glider was made out of foam and fiberglass tape and flight tested to validate the general aerodynamic arrangement: body shape, airfoil sections, and wing sweep.</p>

    <p class="caption">Preliminary analyses were used to optimize the design by maximizing lift and minimizing drag.</p>
</div>


<p>Based on the results of these initial analyses, control surfaces
    were
    sized and added to the models. Elevons, control surfaces that combine the function of elevators and ailerons, were selected as they allow for the best controllability for blended wing body style aircraft. Further design iterations were completed to refine sizing of the control surfaces so that the surfaces afforded sufficient control authority throughout the entire flight envelope. A roughly 2/3 scale model of the Tetracraft was fabricated using foam and fiberclass for final validation of the outer mold line and control surfaces. The model was outfitted with an electric motor and propeller, servos to actuate control surfaces, and an ArduPilot to allow for remote control. The results of wind tunnel and flight tests were used to validate the models generated at the onset of the design process.</p>

         alt="Plotted data from wind

    <p class="caption">Wind tunnel test data indicate that aerodynamic models under-predict drag.</p>
</div>

<h3>Propulsion</h3>
<p>As weight estimates were becoming more accurate, sizing for the propulsion system was finalized. An electric motor and propellor were selected based on the estimated final weight of the aircraft and its payload. Propulsion testing was performed in a wind tunnel, using a force table to measure thrust generated at varying flight conditions. Computations were done to determine how much power would be needed to complete the mission and a battery pack was selected.</p>

<h3>Sensors & Avionics</h3>
<p class="c2-8">In parallel, work on the imaging sensor continued. The chosen
    sensor was the Tetracam, a sensor that captures images in multiple
    wavelengths so that the data can be combined to create a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index">
        Normalized Difference Vegetation Index</a> (NDVI) map of the surveyed
    area. NDVI images indicate the health of plants using color coding to
    highlight areas of good and poor plant health. Image stitching software
    was configured to stitch together individual images to create one image
    of the entire surveyed area.</p>

<div class="img c2-6">
    <img src="{% static "images/avionics.svg" %}" alt="Schematic of avionics
    components and wiring">
</div>
<p class="c6-12">An avionics scheme was developed to support the selected outer mold line and control surfaces. An ArduPilot, an Arduino-based autopilot system, was selected as it allowed the mission to be programmed so that the Tetracraft would be accessible to a novice user. Servos were selected for control surface actuation based on the predicted surface loads. Control laws were developed to map control inputs to surface deflections throughout the flight envelope. A wiring diagram was created for use during assembly.</p>

<h3>Structural Arrangement</h3>
<p class="c2-7">Ribs, spars, and other structural elements were selected based
    on
    anticipated flight loads and added to the CAD (Computer Aided Design) model of the Tetracraft. 3D printed coupons, small sections of material, were tested in the lab to determine material properties to inform a structural model of the Tetracraft. A Finite Element Model (FEM) of the aircraft was created and computer-based structural analyses were performed. The results were used to iterate on the structural arrangement to ensure an adequate factor of safety over the entire flight envelope.</p>

    <p class="caption">Wing bending laboratory test shows skin dimpling at
        maximum load but no plastic deformation.</p>
</div>

<p class="c6-12">Based on structural analysis results, a preliminary structural
    arrangement was determined and two full-scale wings with different skin thicknesses, single ply and double ply, were ordered from the manufacturer for lab testing. Lab tests were performed with all permutations of the two wing designs and three carbon fiber spar configurations (woven, pultruded, none). Wing bending and torsion tests showed no plastic deformation (permanent damage) to either of the wings when a spar was used, but insufficient performance without a carbon fiber spar. As a result, the single ply wing with a pultruded carbon fiber spar, the lightest of the successful combinations, was selected. In addition, test results showed that the structural models developed previously accurately predicted wing deformation at the loads tested and thus could be used to determine loads at other points in the flight envelope.</p>

<h3>Design for Manufacture</h3>
<p>The Tetracraft pioneered the use of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication">
        Fused Deposition Modeling</a> (FDM) printing in the manufacture of
       aircraft. Traditional 3D printed parts are designed as solid objects and are then printed at a specified density. According to the solid model and density, the machine develops a tool path for the printer and the end result is a solid object with a honeycomb structure inside. In addition, surfaces could not be printed at single bead thickness using traditional methods. FDM, on the other hand, allows the designer to model the part as a series of surfaces and solids. The FDM machine then creates a tool path based on the surfaces, printing them at single bead thickness.</p>
<p class="c2-8">The advantage of using FDM in the manufacture of aircraft parts
    is
    that the designer has control over the internal structure of the part. The typical structure of an aircraft wing is made up internal ribs and spars, covered with a thin skin. This arrangement affords the highest possible strength to weight ratio under flight loads. The aircraft wings, body, and winglets were designed so that the internal structure was a series of ribs and spars, allowing for lighter structural weight than an internal honeycomb. Additionally, FDM allowed for a much thinner skin, a single bead thickness, than other printing methods. Therefore, the FDM printed parts could be much lighter than equivalent parts created using traditional 3D printing technologies.</p>

<div class="img c2-5">
    <img src="{% static "images/support_material.svg" %}" alt="Cartoon of
    overhanging 3D-printed material with support material below.">
    <p class="caption">Support material (shown in yellow) is used to support overhanging parts during printing.</p>
</div>

<p class="c5-12">Another consideration in the design process was the elimination
    of
    support material. When parts are 3D printed, if any sections overhang by 45° or more, the printer will need to print a wax-like support material below the overhanging section to prevent it from drooping. After the printing process is complete, the support material can be removed by melting or dissolving it. This process is time-consuming and wasteful. Therefore, a part that eliminates the need for support material will be faster and less expensive to manufacture. The entire Tetracraft was designed so that it could be printed entirely without the use of support material.</p>

<h2>Manufacture and Assembly</h2>
<p class="c2-7">Once the design of the Tetracraft was finalized, the CAD model
    was
    sent to Stratasys for printing. The 3D printed parts and carbon fiber spars were assembled according to assembly drawings. The payload was assembled using a simple jig and inserted into the payload compartment. Ease of assembly was another major benefit of 3D printed parts. If a part were to be damaged in the field, a replacement part could be printed and easily installed by the user.</p>
