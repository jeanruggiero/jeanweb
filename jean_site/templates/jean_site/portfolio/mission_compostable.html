<p>
    Mission: Compostable started as a hackathon project during <a href="https://www.hackher413.com/">Hack(H)er413</a> this year. The goal of the
    project is to help users differentiate between plastic and compostable utensils, cups, lids, etc. Many of these items look like plastic and
    people are often unsure what bin they go in. Compostable utensils won't break down in a landfill; they need to be sent to an industrial
    composting facility. Similarly, putting plastic in the compost bin is costly, and results in contaminated compost. The current form factor is
    a web app for demo and testing purposes, but I hope to build an iPhone app next and maybe even a compost-sorting robot.
</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>
    We wrote an algorithm to differentiate between plastic and compostable spoons given an image of the spoon. Plastic spoons usually have a
    smooth, shiny finish from injection molding, while compostable spoons often have a matte finish. The algorithm detects how "shiny" the spoon is
    from the image and classifies it as compost or trash based on the result. The image processing engine is explained in the Jupyter Notebook
    below. This notebook and image file are also part of the git repository linked above so you can clone it and try it out for yourself!
