<p>Having mostly finished development of my own website, I decided it was time for a new project. React was high on my list of new technologies to learn, so I decided to build a website for my
    significant other, Andrew, and learn React along the way.</p>

<h3>Designing for a Client</h3>
<p>In addition to designing for users, the site needed to be designed for a client (Andrew). I started by thinking about the type of aesthetic that would reflect his personality (organized,
    clean, practical). I decided Material Design fit the bill pretty well and had the added benefit of an extensive React component library. I created a material theme and used that to build
    design prototypes for desktop and mobile in Sketch. I used these to create a clickable prototype in InVision (<a href="https://jeanruggiero459410.invisionapp.com/overview/Andrew-Fabian-Website-ck36hegwq06rr016p31w6kspe/screens?v=h%2F1FwK91Z4sZDIHKn9BX4g%3D%3D&linkshare=urlcopied">check it out</a>). I shared it with Andrew and asked him to use the
        comment feature to point out things he liked and didn't like. Based on this feedback, I further refined the design.
</p>

<h3>Mobile First</h3>
<p>A lesson learned from development of my personal site was that I should have developed the site mobile first. Through that project, I learned first-hand why: it improves loading time on mobile
    devices and has the added benefit of forcing you to ruthlessly prioritize content. I designed and built Andrew's site using the mobile first philosophy, which led to a much better responsive
    design.</p>

<h3>React Fast</h3>
<p>One of the main goals of this project was to learn how to use React, a popular JavaScript library that implements a component-based approach to front end web development. It's somewhat similar
    to template technologies, but at a much lower level. I got the hang of React pretty quickly, but it took me some time to get comfortable with material-ui, a React component library that
    implements many of the principles of Material Design. One of the biggest challenges with learning React and material-ui was that both technologies have recently undergone major changes (class
    components are getting phased out, for example) and
    there was a lack of resources and documentation geared toward learning the latest versions.</p>

<p>Once I got the hang of React and material-ui, I really liked the component-based architecture. It made it easy to reuse components in multiple contexts. The utilities for responsive design are
    also really powerful once you understand how to use them. Another huge benefit is that there is very little css to write, and the styles are encapsulated with components, rather than in a
    separate file (separation of concerns over separation of technologies). For me, this was a far more intuitive approach. That being said, I'm still glad I chose to build my personal website
    using plain html and css for the front end because I learned a lot by doing that. Without knowing what material-ui was doing under the hood, I would have had a hard time getting the layout to
    behave as intended.
