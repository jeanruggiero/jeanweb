<p class="portfolio">As part of a Distributed Systems class project, <a href="https://github.com/Austin-Chow">@Austin-Chow</a>, <a
        href="https://github
.com/philliptvo">@philliptvo</a>, and I created a distributed, peer-to-peer (P2P) microblogging application with functionality similar to that of
    Twitter. The application presents a command line interface which allows users to create blog posts, like posts, re-post posts, and view other
    users' posts.

<p class="portfolio">
    Each user's data is saved to disk on their own device, giving users total control over their own data. When a user wishes to see another
    user's posts, a request is sent directly to that user's peer application instance in order to retrieve the posts.
    We implemented a User Directory microservice which allows peers to obtain the IP address and port of
    other users's peer application instances. The User Directory microservice was implemented as a cluster of containerized Flask apps, each
    containing a replica
    of the user directory. The two-phase commit protocol and distributed transactions were used together to maintain consistency among the replicas
    upon any PUT or POST requests.
