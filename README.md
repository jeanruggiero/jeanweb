This repository houses the files for my personal portfolio website.

## Design Process
Design of this site started with a series of hand sketches to develop concepts and prototype design elements. Next, a site map was created to ensure logical organization of the information on the site. Wireframes were then generated to determine the layout and high level content of each page.

At this point, I transitioned to an iterative design process. The design was moved into Sketch for prototyping. Copy was added to the design and vector icons were generated. The latest Sketch prototypes are [here](https://github.com/jeanruggiero/jeanweb/tree/master/design). The first few pages (home and resume) were prototyped and then exported to InVision and turned into clickable prototypes for testing in the browser on desktop and mobile devices. You can check out the latest clickable protytype [here](https://jeanruggiero459410.invisionapp.com/public/share/6NWU232XG#/screens/474630978). Once these features are shipped, I'll return to the design process for more!

## Development
The first step in the development process was to create infrastructure: initiate a git repository, start a new Django project, choose a CSS framework, etc. The next step will be to create a content layer of the site in HTML. After that, a stylesheet for the site will be created from the design prototype using the Inspect feature in InVision.
